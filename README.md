Playwright, MSTest and C# is used for testing.

If .NET Playwright environment not set up on local machine, please follow this: https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/intro

I wrote some sample UI and API tests in C#. Solution contains two class files with tests.
* UI - CreateEmployee, UpdateEmployee, Login
* API - CreateEmployee, GetEmployeeList

I added two txt files with UI and API bug report.

Code could be refactored to follow better sw development best practices - like DRY etc, but I ommited that from time saving perspective and focused on test functionality.

Solution can be pulled and run in VS2022.
